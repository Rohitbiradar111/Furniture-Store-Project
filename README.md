FurniStore is a modern Furniture Store platform built with React and Vite, featuring a clean and responsive user interface. 
<br>
<br>
Implemented user authentication using OAuth protocols, integrating Google, GitHub, and LinkedIn for seamless and secure login experiences, while React Router was utilized to enable smooth navigation with dynamic routing, nested routes, and route protection for authenticated users.
<br>
<br>
Developed a fully responsive user interface using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a visually appealing and functional design across devices, while Tailwind Forms enhanced form aesthetics and usability. Various React components such as React Alice Carousel, React Select, React Table, and React Rating Stars were integrated to improve interactivity, and Redux was employed for effective state management, maintaining a centralized and predictable data flow throughout the application.
<br>
<br>
Implemented React Helmet for SEO optimization by dynamically managing metadata, improving visibility and indexing on search engines. Form validation was handled with React Hook Form to ensure real-time user input validation, while libphonenumber.js was integrated for international phone number support. Additionally, features such as add-to-cart and add-to-wishlist functionalities were developed, and Razorpay was integrated as a secure payment gateway to facilitate smooth transactions.
<br>
<br>
Employed EmailJS to enable users to send messages directly from the application, promoting immediate communication and engagement. Appwrite was utilized as the backend service to provide authentication.
